## 1. Create a new project

Create a new React or React Native based project using thirdweb.

```bash
npx thirdweb create app --legacy-peer-deps
```

Select your preferences when prompted by the CLI, or use the recommended setup below.

<Accordion title="Recommended application setup">
  We recommend selecting the following options when prompted by the thirdweb CLI:

```bash
✔ What type of project do you want to create? › App
✔ What is your project named? … abstract-thirdweb
✔ What framework do you want to use? › Next.js
```
</Accordion>

Change directory into the newly created project:

```bash
cd abstract-thirdweb
```

## 2. Set up Thirdweb API key

On the [thirdweb dashboard](https://thirdweb.com/dashboard), create your 
account (or sign in), and click **Settings** to reach the 
[API keys](https://thirdweb.com/dashboard/settings/api-keys) page.

Create an API key with localhost included in the allowed domains, then copy your client ID.

Create a `.env` file and add your client ID as an environment variable:

```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_TEMPLATE_CLIENT_ID=your-client-id-here
```

Start the development server with the command below and navigate to [`http://localhost:3000`](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to view the application.

```bash
npm run dev
```

## 3. Connect the app to Abstract

Import `abstractTestnet` from the `thirdweb/chains` package:

```javascript
import { abstractTestnet } from "thirdweb/chains";
```

Use the `abstractTestnet` import as the value for the `chain` property wherever required.

```javascript
<ConnectButton
  client={client}
  chain={abstractTestnet}
/>
```
