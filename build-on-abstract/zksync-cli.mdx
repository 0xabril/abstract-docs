---

As Abstract is built on the [ZK Stack](https://docs.zksync.io/zk-stack), you can use the
[ZKsync CLI](https://docs.zksync.io/build/zksync-cli) to interact with Abstract or run a local Abstract node.
The ZKsync CLI helps simplify the setup, development, testing and deployment of contracts on Abstract.

<Accordion title="Prerequisites">
  Ensure you have the following installed on your machine: -
  [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) v18.0.0 or later. -
  [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) for running a local Abstract
  node.
