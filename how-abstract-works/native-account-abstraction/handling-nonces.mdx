As outlined in the [tranasction flow](/transaction-flow), a call to `validateNonceUsage`
is made to the [NonceHolder](/how-abstract-works/system-contracts/list-of-system-contracts#nonceholder) system contract
before each transaction starts to check whether the provided nonce
of a transaction has already been used or not.

The bootloader enforces the nonce:

1. Has not already been used before transaction validation begins.
2. Must be used (typically incremented) during validation.

## Considering nonces in your smart contract account

{/* If you submit a nonce that is greater than the next expected nonce, the transaction will not be executed until each preceding nonce has been used. */}

To mark a nonce as used there are two options:

1. Increment the `minNonce`: All nonces less than `minNonce` will become used.
2. Set a non-zero value under the nonce via `setValueUnderNonce`.

A convenience method, `incrementMinNonceIfEquals` is exposed
from the `NonceHolder` system contract. For example, inside of your [smart contract wallet](/how-abstract-works/native-account-abstraction/smart-contract-wallets),
you use it to increment the `minNonce` of your account:

function validateTransaction(
    bytes32,
    bytes32,
    Transaction calldata _transaction
) external payable onlyBootloader returns (bytes4 magic) {

    // Increment nonce during validation
    SystemContractsCaller.systemCallWithPropagatedRevert(
        uint32(gasleft()),
        address(NONCE_HOLDER_SYSTEM_CONTRACT),
        0,
        abi.encodeCall(
            INonceHolder.incrementMinNonceIfEquals,
            (_transaction.nonce)
        )
    );

    // ... rest of validation logic here

}
```
