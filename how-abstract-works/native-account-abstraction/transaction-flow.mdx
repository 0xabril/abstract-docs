_Note: This page outlines the flow of transactions on Abstract, not including how they are batched, 
sequenced and verified on Ethereum. For a higher-level overview of how transactions are finalized, see 
[Transaction Lifecycle](/how-abstract-works/architecture/transaction-lifecycle)._

Since all accounts on Abstract are smart contracts, all transactions go through the same flow:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Submitting transactions">
    Transactions are submitted to the network via [JSON-RPC](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/apis/json-rpc/)
    and arrive in the transaction mempool. Since it is up to the smart contract account to determine how to validate transactions,
    the `from` field can be set to a smart contract address in this step and submitted to the network.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Bootloader processing">
    The [bootloader](/how-abstract-works/system-contracts/bootloader) reads transactions from the mempool
    and processes them in batches.

    Before each transaction starts, the system queries the [NonceHolder](/how-abstract-works/system-contracts/nonceholder) system contract
    to check whether the provided nonce has already been used or not. If it has not been used, the process continues. 
    Learn more on [handling nonces](./handling-nonces.mdx).
    
    For each transaction, the bootloader reads the `tx.from` field and checks if there is any contract code deployed at that address.
    If there is no contract code, it assumes the account is an EOA and converts it to a 
    [DefaultAccount](/how-abstract-works/native-account-abstraction/smart-contract-accounts).

</Step>

<Step title="Smart contract account validation & execution">
    The bootloader then calls the following functions on account deployed at the `tx.from` address:
  
    1. `validateTransaction`: Determine whether or not to execute the transaction. 
    Typically, some kind of [signature validation](./signature-validation.mdx) is performed in this step to restrict who can use the account.
    2. `executeTransaction`: Execute the transaction if validation passed.
    3. Either `payForTransaction` or `prepareForPayment`: Pay the gas fee or request a paymaster to pay the gas fee for this transaction.
  
    The `msg.sender` is set as the bootloader&rsquo;s formal contract address for these function calls.

  </Step>

<Step title="Paymasters (optional)">
    If a paymaster is set, the bootloader call the following [paymaster](./paymasters.mdx) functions:
        1. `validateAndPayForPaymasterTransaction`: Determine whether or not to pay for the transaction, and if so, pay the calculated gas fee for the transaction.
        2. `postTransaction`: Optionally run some logic after the transaction has been executed.

    Again, the `msg.sender` is set as the bootloader&rsquo;s formal contract address for these function calls.
