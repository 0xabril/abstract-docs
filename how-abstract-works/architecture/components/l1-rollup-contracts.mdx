description: "Learn more about the smart contracts deployed on L1 that enable Abstract to inherit the security properties of Ethereum."

An essential part of Abstract as a [ZK rollup](/how-abstract-works/architecture/layer-2s#what-is-a-zk-rollup)
is the smart contracts deployed to Ethereum (L1) that store and verify information about the
state of the L2.

By having these smart contracts deployed and performing these essential
roles on the L1, Abstract inherits the security properties of Ethereum.

These smart contracts work together to:

- Store the state diffs and compressed contract bytecode published from the L2 using [blobs](https://info.etherscan.com/what-is-a-blob/).
- Receive and verify the validity proofs posted by the L2.
- Facilitate communication between L1 and L2 to enable
  cross-chain messaging and bridging.
