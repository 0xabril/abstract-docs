title: "Gas Fees"
description: "Learn how Abstract differs from Ethereum's EVM opcodes."
---

Abstract&rsquo;s gas fees depend on the fluctuating
[gas prices](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/gas/) on Ethereum. As mentioned in
the [transaction lifecycle](/how-abstract-works/architecture/transaction-lifecycle)
section, Abstract posts state diffs _(as well as compressed contract bytecode)_ to Ethereum
in the form of [blobs](https://www.eip4844.com/).

In addition to the gas fees paid to Ethereum, their are costs associated with generating
ZK proofs for batches and committing & verifying these proofs on Ethereum. To fairly distribute
these costs among L2 transactions, gas fees on Abstract are charged proportionally
to how close a transaction brought a batch to being **sealed** (i.e. full).

## Gas Fees & Refunds

You may notice that a portion of gas fees are **refunded** transactions on Abstract. This
is because accounts don&rsquo;t have access to the `block.baseFee` context variable,
so have no way to know the exact fee to pay for a transaction.

Instead, the following steps are taken to refund users for any excess funds spent on a transaction:

<Steps>

<Step title="Block overhead fee deduction">
  Upfront, the payment for the overhead for the block&rsquo;s processing is
  deducted.
</Step>

<Step title="Gas price calculation">
  The gas price for the transaction is then calculated according to the
  [EIP1559](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-1559.md)
  rules.
</Step>

<Step title="Gas price calculation">
  The **maximum** amount of gas (gas limit) for the transaction is deducted from
  the account by the account typically sending `tx.maxFeePerErg * tx.ergsLimit`.
  The transaction is then executed (see [transaction
  flow](/how-abstract-works/native-account-abstraction/transaction-flow)).
</Step>

<Step title="Gas refund">
    Since the account may have overpaid for the transaction, the bootloader
    **refunds** the account any excess funds spent to the account.
</Step>
</Steps>
