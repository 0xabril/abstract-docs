Smart contract deployment works differently on Abstract than Ethereum.
Specifically, the code hash for each smart contract needs to be published on the
[KnownCodesStorage](/how-abstract-works/system-contracts/list-of-system-contracts#knowncodesstorage)
system contract before it can be deployed.

In addition, if a subsequent
contract deployment uses the same code hash (i.e. the contract code is the same),
the contract deployment will be substantially cheaper as the
code hash does not need to be published to Ethereum again.

For this reason, contract deployments on Abstract **must** be performed using EIP-712 transactions,
with the `factory_deps` field containing the bytecode of the smart contract being deployed.

## Contract Deployment Flow

<Steps>
  <Step title="Bootloader processes transaction">
    The [bootloader](/how-abstract-works/system-contracts/bootloader) receives
    an [EIP-712](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-712) transaction that defines
    a contract deployment. This transaction must:

    1. Call the `create` or `create2` function on the `ContractDeployer` system contract.
    2. Provide a salt, the formatted hash of the contract bytecode, and the constructor calldata as arguments.
    3. Inside the `factory_deps` field of the transaction, include the bytecode of the smart contract being deployed
    as well as the bytecodes of any other contracts that this contract can deploy (such as if it is a factory contract).

    <Accordion title="See the create function signature">

      ```solidity
      /// @notice Deploys a contract with similar address derivation rules to the EVM's `CREATE` opcode.
      /// @param _bytecodeHash The correctly formatted hash of the bytecode.
      /// @param _input The constructor calldata
      /// @dev This method also accepts nonce as one of its parameters.
      /// It is not used anywhere and it needed simply for the consistency for the compiler
      /// Note: this method may be callable only in system mode,
      /// that is checked in the `createAccount` by `onlySystemCall` modifier.
      function create(
          bytes32 _salt,
          bytes32 _bytecodeHash,
          bytes calldata _input
      ) external payable override returns (address) {
        // ...
      }
    ```

    </Accordion>

    <Tip>
        If you are deploying from a client _(i.e. not within a smart contract)_, use the [zksync-ethers](https://sdk.zksync.io/js/ethers/api/v6/contract/contract-factory)
        or [hardhat-zksync](/build-on-abstract/smart-contracts/hardhat) library to easily create EIP-712 deploy transactions.
    </Tip>

  </Step>
  <Step title="Marking contract as known and publishing compressed bytedata">
    Under the hood, the bootloader informs the
    [KnownCodesStorage](/how-abstract-works/system-contracts/list-of-system-contracts#knowncodesstorage) system contract
    about the contract code hash.
    This is required for all contract deployments on Abstract.

    The `KnownCodesStorage` then calls the
    [Compressor](/how-abstract-works/system-contracts/list-of-system-contracts#compressor), which subsequently calls the
    [L1Messenger](/how-abstract-works/system-contracts/list-of-system-contracts#l1messenger)
    system contract to publish the hash of the compressed contract bytecode to
    Ethereum (assuming this same contract code hash has not been published before).

  </Step>
  <Step title="Smart contract account execution">
    Once the bootloader finishes calling the other system contracts to ensure the contract code hash is known,
    and the contract code is published to Ethereum,
    it continues executing the transaction as described in the 
    [tranasction flow](/how-abstract-works/native-account-abstraction/transaction-flow) section.

    This flow includes invoking the contract deployer account&rsquo;s `validateTransaction` and `executeTransaction` functions; which
    will determine whether to deploy the contract and how to execute the deployment tranasction respectively.

    Learn more about these functions on the [smart contract wallets](/how-abstract-works/native-account-abstraction/smart-contract-wallets) section, or
    view an example implementation in the [DefaultAccount](/how-abstract-works/system-contracts/list-of-system-contracts#defaultaccount).
